# -3-Octave

The R syntax is confusing to learn. Plus, matrices are not a first class object in R (or Python for that matter) the way they are in Octave. For example, * is matrix multiplication, quote(‘) is matrix transpose. As a result, the syntax for an expression in Octave is relatively clean compared to R.

Thus advantage then for Octave over R, is that the class can be more focused on Machine Learning (ML) and not on syntactical weirdness.

Once the ML concepts are learned, it’s relatively easy to apply them in any language you desire. I think it’s a wise choice.

Actually Octave is a high level language. The Machine Learning course on coursera has focused more on ML concepts rather than syntax. Its easier to implement mathematical operations like matrix multiplication, transpose etc in Octave than to write long lines of code in R. In R we use inbuilt functions provided by various packages. So its difficult to decide whether the data set has high bias or high variance.

Once you are thorough with the concepts you can implement them in any language
